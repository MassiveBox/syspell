## ☑️ Features
- [x] Spell checker

   <details>
      <summary>Why does this matter?</summary>

  The plugin's underlines are not rendered by altering the content of your note, but as an overlay.
  This way, when exporting notes from SiYuan to HTML or Markdown, the underlines aren't shown, and they don't interfere with your writing.  
  It's just like how the [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/making-grammarly-feel-native-on-every-website/) web extensions works!

## 🛠 Contributing
I'm respecting LanguageTool's guidelines by running a LanguageTool server, on my own hardware, for the benefit of this
plugin's users, instead of having them use the official one.  
I'm providing this service for free, but it's not free for me to run it: the LanguageTool server is very resource intensive.  
If you can, consider [donating](https://s.massive.box/siyuan-plugin-donate) to help me keep it up forever. Thanks!

You can also contribute by opening an issue or a pull request. Thanks!
